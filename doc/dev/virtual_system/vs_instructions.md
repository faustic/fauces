## Virtual system version 1: CPU instructions

### Application of proposed design principles

* Simplicity: few instructions; no built-in arithmetic instructions, only
bitwise operations; no built-in signed integer format; fixed-length
instructions; separate load, store and operation instructions.
* Flexibility: pointer size adapted to memory size; derivatives with a different
operand size are easy to design.

### Instruction codification

Every instruction takes exactly eight bits, forming one byte. Six bits
represent the opcode, one bit represents the source register and one bit
represents the destination register. Instructions that do not take two
parameters may ignore the corresponding unused bits or require fixed values
for them or use them to define instruction variants.

```
|------------------------------------------------|
|                 OPCODE             | SRC | DST |
|------------------------------------------------|
```

As an exception, the `sori` instruction, does not expect a source register,
but a 4-bit immediate value overlapping with the opcode.

### Instruction description

We use a C-like syntax to describe the action of CPU instructions. An implicit
`++PC` is executed before the action of every instruction.

The content of a register is always interpreted as an unsigned 64-bit value.

The expression `A & PM` (where A can be any of R0, R1, S0, S1, X0, X1, PC or the
sum of two of them) is always interpreted as a pointer to an 8-bit value.

A 64-bit value is always assumed to be converted into an 8-bit value before
assigning it to a byte in memory, by truncating it to the least significant 8
bits.

An 8-bit value is always assumed to be converted into a 64-bit value before
using it in any operation, by using the eight original bits as the least
significant bits of the 64-bit value and setting the most significant bits as
zero.
