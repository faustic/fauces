## DOCUMENTATION STRATEGY

### 1. Introduction

* Both the source code and the user interface should be as **self-documenting** 
as possible.
* Documentation should be **well-organised**. A lot of documentation can be as
bad as no documentation if it is badly organised.
* Documentation should be organised in a **task-oriented** way, making it easy
to find documentation for a particular purpose.

### 2. Self-documenting programs

#### Source code

* Most source lines should be self-explanatory without the need of comments.
* If comments are nevertheless needed, they should take as few words as
possible.
* Care should be taken not to distract from the actual code with too many
comment lines; when lengthy explanations are advisable, it is better to add them
through references to external documents. 

#### User interface

* When a command line tool expects parameters, the available options should be
displayed when running without parameters.
* When a command line tool is invoked with incorrect syntax, users should
receive enough information to correct the syntax.
* If a program uses a graphical user interface, it should be easy to understand
and operate without the need to search documentation.
* Graphical user interfaces should not be cluttered: there should be a clearly
visible way to perform every basic task, while access to advanced tasks should
be organised in such a way that it is easy to figure out but does not overshadow
other tasks.

### 3. Well-organised documentation

* Documentation should be easy to find.
* Documentation should be easy to explore.
* A documentation map should provide a well-organised general view of the
available documentation.

### 4. Task-oriented documentation

* Documentation should be task-oriented: users generally look for documentation
when they are not sure about how to perform a certain task.
* Task orientation should not obscure but stimulate a general understanding of
the project and its different parts.
