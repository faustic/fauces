## PROJECT STATUS

### Summarised situation

* The project lacks resources and has long periods of inactivity.
* Some documentation has been created:
    * A rudimentary strategy has been proposed:
        * General goals have been stated.
        * There is a roadmap with no deadlines.
    * Some implementation ideas have been suggested.
        * Language translation phases have been summarised.
        * Target conventions have been explained and reference targets have been chosen.
        * A virtual system has been specified as the basis of a virtual target.
* Some programming has been done to experiment around implementation ideas:
    * A tentative virtual system.
    * Examples of integer operations defined in terms of other integer operations.
    * An incipient C++ compiler that for now just does some token parsing.
    * Some minimal C++ programs, each one intended for the incipient C++ compiler to test a single C++ feature.

### Latest significant achievements

* 22 April 2022: work on incipient compiler is deemed enough for initial experimenting.
* 30 May 2022: documentation for reference targets is finished, at least to the extent we consider necessary to start development.
 
### Short term goals

* Adapt `cpp_visyv1_i16` experiment to specified directory layout.
* Minimalistic compiler foundations.
