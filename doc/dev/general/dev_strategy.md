## DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY

### Current strategy

The project starts in a context of vapour: the project has no dedicated
resources and gets only sporadic attention (see dedication contexts below).

#### 1. Management strategy

There is not a dedicated project manager. Programmers must manage their own work
and, if there is more than one, do their best to coordinate their contributions.
Internal programmers should have permission to create and assign issues and
define milestones.

#### 2. Reviewing strategy

There are no dedicated code reviewers. Some staff members may be given
privileges to accept or reject external contributions and they may do so when
they are not busy. Contributions from internal programmers are automatically
accepted.

#### 3. Programming and documentation strategy ####

Programming and documentation are not done regularly. A staff member that gets a small amount of time to write documentation or do programming for the project should follow a procedure like this:

1. If time is up, stop.
2. Look for issues assigned to you.
3. If an issue exists assigned to you: try to address the issue until it can be closed or unassigned or time is up; go to 1.
    * You can close an issue if it is solved or if it need not be solved (e.g. if it is unrelated to this project or it goes beyond the scope of this project...). 
    * You can unassign from you an open issue if you lack the time or knowledge to solve it. An appropriate label should be added to hint how to deal with the issue in the future (kind of task, kind of required knowledge, divide into smaller tasks...). 
4. If no issue exists assigned to you, look for unassigned issues.
5. If unassigned issues exist: assign an issue to yourself; go to 1.
6. If no issues exist: try to create a new issue and assign it to yourself; go to 1.
    * To create a new issue it is a good idea to check the project [roadmap](roadmap.md) and [status](status.md).
    * If the roadmap and status are not up-to-date or not detailed enough, you may create an issue to update them and expand them.

Concerning documentation, there are additional hints in a [separate document](doc_strategy.md). Concerning programming, we intend to write a style guide on the fly as needs arise.

### Dedication contexts

At a given time, the project may be in one of different contexts according to
available resources. The current context determines the current strategy.

#### 1. Vapour 

* The project has no resources of its own. Particularly:
    * No dedicated project managers.
    * No dedicated code reviewers.
    * No dedicated programmers.
* Resources may be allocated sometimes from leftovers of other projects, but in
a sporadic and unpredictable way.

##### Strategy highlights for vapour

1. While the project remains in a context of vapour, workers should manage their
own work assignments.
2. If after some time in a context of vapour the project looks promising, it
should be given enough funds to get to a context of tiny team.
3. If after some time in a context of vapour the project looks unpromising, it
should be abandoned.

#### 2. Tiny team

* The project has some fixed resources allocated, but no more than three
full-time workers.
* Workers may or may be not specialised as project managers, code reviewers or
programmers.

##### Strategy highlights for tiny team

No strategy highlights have been defined yet for a context of tiny team.

#### 3. Chaos

* The project has more than three full-time workers allocated, but less than one
half-time project manager or less than one half-time code reviewer.

##### Strategy highlights for chaos

The strategy for this context should consist of changing the context. This means
either getting at least one half-time project manager and one half-time code
reviewer as required by a small team, or dismissing enough workers to become a
tiny team.

#### 4. Small team

* The project has more than three and no more than six full-time workers
allocated.
* There is at least one half-time project manager.
* There is at least one half-time code reviewer.

##### Strategy highlights for small team

No strategy highlights have been defined yet for a context of small team.

#### 5. Grown team

* The project has more than six full-time workers allocated.
* There is at least one half-time project manager.
* There is at least one half-time code reviewer.

#### Strategy highlights for grown team

No strategy highlights have been defined yet for a context of grown team.

#### 6. Other contexts

Strategies for contexts not contemplated here may be studied at a later stage
if at some point their occurrence becomes not unlikely.
