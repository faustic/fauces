## ROADMAP

Project phases:

1. Initial planning. -- *Done: 9 December 2020* --
2. Initial experimenting. -- *Done: 30 May 2022* --
3. Language.
4. Library.
5. Standard.

A phase may start before the previous phase has ended, unless there is something
not yet ready from the previous phase that is required by the phase being
started.
