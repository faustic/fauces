## Phases of translation

The C++ standard defines nine phases of translation. Implementations do not need to explicitly implement these phases as long as the behaviour is the same as if they did.

In our first tries, we intend to implement each phase explicitly and clearly separated from the others. As we get more familiar with the translation process, we may instead decide to join several phases together or do things in a more optimal order.

* [Phase 1](phase1.md)
* [Phase 2](phase2.md)
* [Phase 3](phase3.md)
* [Phase 4](phase4.md)
* [Phase 5](phase5.md)
* [Phase 6](phase6.md)
* [Phase 7](phase7.md)
* [Phase 8](phase8.md)
* [Phase 9](phase9.md)
