## Description

This is a command line utility that sends a test program to a W65C02SXB card, waits for the card to complete execution and then retrieves the result.

W65C02SXB is a card from The Western Design Center. It has a 65C02 processor, which we wanted to use to compare our emulator's behaviour with that of a real processor.

We cannot guarantee that this tool works on any W65C02SXB card. It has been tested on a W65C02SXB card labelled as *Rev. C*, whose installed ROM has the following signature:

We learned how to communicate with the card thanks to [Andrew Jacob's Uploader source code](https://github.com/andrew-jacobs/dev65/blob/master/src/com/wdc65xx/sxb/Uploader.java).

Recently we added some support for the W65C816SXB card, which is similar but with a 65C816 processor.

Syntax:

    w65c02sxbrun --input <executable> --output <result> --port <serialport>

Note that the expected executable format is our own, generated by our [test generation tool](https://github.com/faustic/fauces/blob/main/experimenting/65x/java/65c02/src/com/faustic/cpu/wdc65x/Test_gen.java).

The name of the serial port depends on your operating system and on your particular hardware configuration:

* On Windows, it's usually "COM" followed by a number. For example, `COM3`.
* On Debian, it's usually "/dev/ttyUSB" followed by a number. For example, `/dev/ttyUSB0`.
* On macOS, it's usually "/dev/cu.usbserial-" followed by some character sequence. For example, `/dev/cu.usbserial-AK08OIQD`.
