# 65C02 emulator

This emulator, from one of our unpublished projects, has been brought here because it might be of use if we ever implement the `65c02_prodos` retrocomputing target.

The emulator has been written in C++ based on a previous implementation for Java.

The implementation for Java, also brought here, is more complete. In addition to the emulator, it includes:

* A 65C02 disassembler.
* A 65C02 assembler (or more precisely a 65C02 code generator, as it doesn't actually do assembly source code parsing).
* A collection of test program generators.
* A collection of test binaries generated by the test program generators. Note that the format of these binaries is specific for our emulator. It is neither the Fo16 format we have defined elsewhere nor a standard format.
