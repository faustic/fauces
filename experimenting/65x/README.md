# 65C02 emulator

This emulator, from one of our unpublished projects, has been brought here because it might be of use if we ever implement the `65c02_prodos` retrocomputing target.

The emulator has been written in C++ based on a previous implementation for Java.

The implementation for Java is more complete, so maybe it should also be brought here.
